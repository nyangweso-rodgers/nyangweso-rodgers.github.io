# Recap
* `padding` is the space between the _content_ of an element and its `border`.  It creates an inner space within the element.

* `margin` is the space outside the `border` of an element. It creates a `gap` _between the element and its neighboring elements_.  You can think of it as the external space or clearance around an element.
